# Introduction to YAML

YAML is a very simple, text/human-readable annotation format that can be used to store data introduced by Clark Evans in 2001. It is commonly used for configuration files, but could be used in many applications where data is being stored (like XML).

It supports JSON, another minimalist data serialization format where braces and brackets are used instead of indentation.
